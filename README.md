# Overview

This repository contains code for the [21 Recipes for Mining Twitter](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018261) (O'Reilly, 2011.) The code in this repository has been freshened to be compatible with Twitter's v1.1 API changes that affected nearly all of this book in mid-April 2013, but the text of the book has not been updated. If you benefit from the code in this repository, the best way to show your appreciation would be by liking the [Mining the Social Web](https://www.facebook.com/MiningTheSocialWeb) Facebook page, following [@SocialWebMining](http://twitter.com/socialwebmining) on Twitter, and pre-ordering _Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition_ as soon as it's available. It's going to be a amazing book that will be a significant rewrite of the 1st Edition and will incorporate all of these recipes and many more in an expanded part of the book on Twitter.
